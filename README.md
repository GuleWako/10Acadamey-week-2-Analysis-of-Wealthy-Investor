## Project Overview

This project investigates user behavior and satisfaction in telecommunication.

## Data

The project utilizes a telecom dataset containing user information, usage data, and network metrics.

## Functionality

### This project performs the following tasks:

* **User Overview Analysis:** Identifies top handsets, manufacturers, and analyzes user behavior.
* **User Engagement Analysis:** Calculates engagement metrics (session frequency, duration, traffic) and segments users based on k-means clustering.
* **Experience Analysis:** Analyzes network parameters (TCP retransmission, RTT, throughput) and handset characteristics.
* **Satisfaction Analysis:** Calculates satisfaction scores based on engagement and experience metrics. Develops a regression model to predict satisfaction scores.
